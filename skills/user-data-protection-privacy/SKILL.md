description: >
  Use when a WordPress plugin or theme stores, processes, or exposes personal data —
  emails, names, IP addresses, user content, or analytics. Registers data exporters and
  erasers via wp_privacy_personal_data_exporters / _erasers, declares privacy policy
  content, anonymizes IPs, and minimizes/secures PII. Helps meet GDPR/CCPA obligations.
  Apply proactively whenever code touches personally identifiable information.

# User data protection & privacy

## When to use this skill

Use this skill whenever code handles **personal data**:

- Storing emails, names, addresses, phone numbers, IPs, or user-generated content.
- Logging requests/analytics that capture IPs or identifiers.
- Building forms, CRMs, comment features, membership/e-commerce data.
- Integrating third-party services that receive user data.

WordPress ships privacy tooling (export/erase requests, policy content) since 4.9.6.
Plugins that store PII should integrate with it. Applicable privacy duties depend on
jurisdiction and the site's processing; these integrations alone do not establish legal
compliance. Minimizing data also reduces the impact of a security breach.

## Core principles (and why they matter)

1. **Data minimization.** Collect and retain only what the feature needs. Less stored PII
   means less to leak, export, or erase.
2. **Integrate with WordPress privacy tools.** Register an **exporter** and an **eraser** so
   the admin's Export/Erase Personal Data screens include your plugin's data — users have a
   right to access and deletion.
3. **Declare what you collect.** Use `wp_add_privacy_policy_content()` so the suggested
   privacy policy reflects your plugin's data practices.
4. **Anonymize where identity isn't needed.** Store anonymized IPs
   (`wp_privacy_anonymize_ip()`) and use `wp_privacy_anonymize_data()` for other types.
5. **Secure PII at rest and in transit.** Restrict who can read it (capabilities), don't
   expose it in REST/AJAX to under-privileged users, and never log secrets.
6. **Honor consent and retention.** Gate optional collection behind consent; delete data on
   schedule and on erasure requests.

## Step-by-step implementation

1. Map what PII you store and where (tables, options, meta).
2. Register an exporter on `wp_privacy_personal_data_exporters` returning the user's data in
   the expected paginated structure.
3. Register an eraser on `wp_privacy_personal_data_erasers` that deletes/anonymizes that data
   and reports what it did.
4. Add policy text via `admin_init` → `wp_add_privacy_policy_content()`.
5. Anonymize IPs at capture; minimize fields; set retention.
6. Gate any display/export of PII behind capability checks.
7. For consent-required tracking, configure a real consent manager to block script,
   pixel, and iframe loading until the relevant category is explicitly allowed. Unknown
   or denied is not consent. Shared cached HTML must remain tracker-free/inert until
   the visitor's client-side consent check; a PHP cookie gate alone is unsafe with
   shared page/CDN caches. Gate server-side collection separately and provide withdrawal.

## Common AI mistakes / anti-patterns

### Mistake 1 — Storing PII with no export/erase integration

```php
// Missing integration: data is invisible to WordPress' privacy tools.
add_option( 'my_newsletter_subscribers', array() ); // emails with no exporter/eraser
```

```php
// Register exporter + eraser so requests cover this data.
add_filter( 'wp_privacy_personal_data_exporters', 'my_plugin_register_exporter' );
add_filter( 'wp_privacy_personal_data_erasers',  'my_plugin_register_eraser' );
```

### Mistake 2 — Storing full IP addresses unnecessarily

```php
// ❌ Excessive: full IP retained for basic analytics/anti-spam.
$ip = $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'];
$wpdb->insert( $table, array( 'ip' => $ip ) );
```

```php
// ✅ Minimized: anonymize the IP before storing.
$raw = isset( $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'] )
    ? sanitize_text_field( wp_unslash( $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'] ) )
    : '';
$ip  = wp_privacy_anonymize_ip( $raw );
$wpdb->insert(
    $wpdb->prefix . 'my_log',
    array( 'ip' => $ip ),
    array( '%s' )
);
```

### Mistake 3 — Exposing PII to under-privileged users

```php
// ❌ Insecure: any subscriber can read everyone's emails via the endpoint.
'permission_callback' => '__return_true',
'callback'            => fn() => get_option( 'my_newsletter_subscribers' ),
```

```php
// ✅ Secure: gate PII behind a capability.
'permission_callback' => static fn() => current_user_can( 'list_users' ),
```

### Mistake 4 — Eraser that doesn't report or doesn't actually erase

```php
// ❌ Broken: returns nothing; admin tool can't confirm erasure.
function my_eraser( $email, $page ) {
    delete_metadata( /* ... */ );
}
```

```php
// ✅ Correct: delete/anonymize AND return the documented status array.
function my_eraser( $email, $page = 1 ) {
    $removed = my_plugin_delete_subscriber( $email );
    return array(
        'items_removed'  => $removed,
        'items_retained' => false,
        'messages'       => array(),
        'done'           => true,
    );
}
```

### Mistake 5 — Collecting consent-optional data without consent

```php
// ❌ Risky: marketing opt-in assumed.
$wpdb->insert( $table, array( 'email' => $email, 'marketing' => 1 ) );
```

```php
// ✅ Respect explicit consent.
// The form's opt-in checkbox has value="yes"; nonce verified upstream.
$consent = isset( $_POST['marketing_consent'] ) && 'yes' === $_POST['marketing_consent'] ? 1 : 0;
$wpdb->insert(
    $wpdb->prefix . 'my_subs',
    array( 'email' => sanitize_email( wp_unslash( $_POST['email'] ?? '' ) ), 'marketing' => $consent ),
    array( '%s', '%d' )
);
```

### Mistake 6 — Tracking scripts enqueued before consent

```php
// Risky: consent-required analytics loads before any consent decision.
add_action( 'wp_enqueue_scripts', function () {
    wp_enqueue_script( 'my-analytics', 'https://cdn.example.com/analytics.js', array(), '1.0', true );
} );
```

For example, with **Cookiebot CMP installed and configured for explicit opt-in**,
use its documented manual-blocking markup for a statistics script instead of an
unconditional `wp_enqueue_script()` call. Replace the illustrative URL with the
actual tracker; do not also load it via a theme, tag manager, or another plugin.

```html
<!-- Inert in shared cached HTML; Cookiebot activates only for allowed statistics. -->
<script type="text/plain" data-cookieconsent="statistics"
        src="https://cdn.example.com/analytics.js"></script>
```

The selected manager must load correctly and cover every tracking entry point.
For another manager, use its documented blocking integration, not Cookiebot-specific
attributes or a made-up consent cookie. A cookie may encode a denial; its presence
or nonempty value is not permission. WP Consent API is an interoperability plugin,
not a banner or script blocker, and its consent-type configuration matters.

Blocking only initialization after a normal script `src` has loaded is too late: the
network request already disclosed data. Keep trackers inert in shared HTML and gate
server-side tracking separately; do not let a cached consenting response authorize
another visitor. Also cover tag managers, dynamically inserted embeds, and preloads.

Provide a persistent consent-settings/withdrawal control (for Cookiebot, its Privacy
Trigger and documented `renew()`/`withdraw()` APIs). On withdrawal or category denial,
stop future collection and remove optional cookies/storage as appropriate using the
tracker's documented teardown; reload into a blocked state if scripts cannot be
safely stopped. Removing a script tag does not undo executed code or already sent
data. Verify unknown, denied, granted, and withdrawn states in browser network and
storage tools, including warm shared caches. This is an implementation pattern, not
a guarantee of GDPR/CCPA or other legal compliance.

### Mistake 7 — Erasing the primary record but not its copies

```php
// ❌ Incomplete: the eraser clears the plugin table, but copies survive in a
// transient cache, a search index table, a public export file, and debug logs.
function my_plugin_eraser( $email, $page = 1 ) {
    global $wpdb;
    $wpdb->delete( $wpdb->prefix . 'my_plugin_leads', array( 'email' => $email ) );
    return array( 'items_removed' => true, 'items_retained' => false, 'messages' => array(), 'done' => true );
}
```

```php
// ✅ Secure: erase every derived copy the plugin owns, and report honestly.
function my_plugin_eraser( $email, $page = 1 ) {
    global $wpdb;
    $ids = $wpdb->get_col( $wpdb->prepare( "SELECT id FROM {$wpdb->prefix}my_plugin_leads WHERE email = %s", $email ) );
    foreach ( $ids as $id ) {
        delete_transient( 'my_plugin_lead_' . (int) $id );
        $wpdb->delete( $wpdb->prefix . 'my_plugin_search_index', array( 'lead_id' => (int) $id ) );
    }
    $removed = (bool) $wpdb->delete( $wpdb->prefix . 'my_plugin_leads', array( 'email' => $email ) );
    return array(
        'items_removed'  => $removed,
        'items_retained' => false,
        'messages'       => array(),
        'done'           => true,
    );
}
```

Inventory derived data too: caches and transients, search or analytics tables, export
files, logs, and records restored from backups or imports. Also clean up on
`delete_user`, and never write export files to a public, guessable `uploads/` path.

## Correct code examples

A complete exporter + eraser registration and a privacy-policy-content example are in
[`references/privacy-data-handlers.php`](references/privacy-data-handlers.php).

Related: see the `woocommerce-security` skill for order and customer PII handling, and
the `cron-background-job-security` and `http-api-ssrf-prevention` skills — IP
anonymization and retention limits apply to logs written by cron jobs and outbound HTTP
helpers too.

## Checklist

- [ ] All stored PII is inventoried (tables, options, meta).
- [ ] An exporter is registered on `wp_privacy_personal_data_exporters`.
- [ ] An eraser is registered on `wp_privacy_personal_data_erasers` and returns the status array.
- [ ] Privacy policy content declared via `wp_add_privacy_policy_content()`.
- [ ] IPs anonymized with `wp_privacy_anonymize_ip()` unless full IPs are required.
- [ ] Only necessary fields collected; retention/cleanup defined.
- [ ] PII display/export gated behind capability checks.
- [ ] Consent-optional data is gated behind explicit consent; unknown/denied states do not enable it.
- [ ] A configured consent manager blocks tracker loading before category opt-in, including shared cached pages.
- [ ] Consent can be withdrawn; subsequent collection stops and optional storage is handled appropriately.
- [ ] Cookies and trackers are disclosed in the suggested privacy policy content.
- [ ] PII not leaked in REST/AJAX responses to under-privileged users.
- [ ] No PII or secrets written to logs.
- [ ] Erasers and user deletion also remove derived copies: caches/transients, search or analytics tables, generated export files, and logs.
- [ ] Generated export or backup files are not stored at public, guessable URLs and are deleted after download or expiry.
- [ ] Import and restore paths re-apply current ownership and capability checks instead of trusting stored author or user IDs.
